May not properly affect mobs who change ranges for specific attacks. * demon_blood;[ratio]   - Demon blood's damage multiplier can now be controlled. Default is x5. XP bonus reduced by proportion of [ratio] to 5 (max x2XP). * set_tele_hunter;[freq]    - In a magical flash, mob teleports to a random yaw near its attack target every [freq] seconds. Modifies XP immensely based on [freq], base 20 secs. * set_tele_hunter_random;[freq]     - Mob periodically teleports to a random player, in said magical flash (including AFK's). Modifies XP and defaults as above.     - tele hunters whose primary attack is ranged will attempt to teleport some distance from targets, rather than directly next to them. * set_say_spawn;&lt;'text'&gt;    - causes the mob to say something when it spawns   - be sure to use single quotes (') not doubles (\"), or your compiler will crash. Also, be careful of apostrophe contractions and odd characters, there is no sanitation! * set_say_spot;&lt;'text'&gt;     - causes the mob to say something when it first spots an enemy. * set_say_die;&lt;'text'&gt;  - causes the mob to say something when it dies. * add_dot_poison;[ratio]    - gives the mob poison dot (not the potentially insane DOT of set_poisonous, which has also been fixed)    - adjusts XP. You can, optionally, increase the damage (and XP) with [ratio]. * add_dot_cold;[ratio]  - Same, with cold DOT * add_dot_fire;[ratio]  - Same, with fire DOT * add_dot_lightning;[ratio]     - Same, with lightning DOT     - Poison has double the duration, but less damage. Cold does less damage, but slows. Fire does the most damage. Lightning DOT has slightly longer duration than the other two, but less than poison, and reduces accuracy.     - Critters gain appropriate flavor of glow shell    - you can stack these, but the glow shell will just be the color of which ever you applied last. * set_takedmg;  - set_takedmg;lightning:0.25 would make a mob 75% lightning resistant. This currently has no XP adjustment. (Note: colon seperator in the second parametert, not semi    -colon) * set_notarget;&lt;0|1&gt;    - Flags NPC to be ignored by other NPCs, regardless of race or attacks. (alias for ext_invalidate) * For elemental_fire_guardian2  -3 and elemental_ice_guardian2    -3 (shender_east/ or monsters/ variants): set_agro  - removes some of the 'stand -offish' defensive features of these boss mobs and escorts, making them more aggressive."},{"location":"Developer-Knowledge-Articles/Archived-MSC-Patchnotes/2015_FEBa/#new-developer-commands","title":"New Developer Commands","text":"<pre><code>- For those that have access to them, these help with testing scripts:\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>devcmd event  [params...]     - calls a scripted event on the NPC you are targeting. <li>devcmd eventme  [params...]   - calls a scripted event on your player script. <li>devcmd eventall  [params...]  - calls a scripted event on all present NPCs, players, and items. <li>devcmd eventgm  [params...]   - calls a scripted event on the game_master.<ul> <li>Replace any parameter with ME or GM, to cause the parameter to be replaced with your player ent ID or the game_master's ent ID, respectively.</li> <li>(So, for instance, \"devcmd eventall npcatk_settarget ME\" would cause all mobs on the map to attempt to target you.)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Developer-Knowledge-Articles/Archived-MSC-Patchnotes/2015_FEBa/#test_scripts","title":"Test_Scripts","text":"<ul> <li>We've added a BOATLOAD of new reference and example scripts to the test_scripts folder, including brush scripts and NPC on NPC interaction scripts, and about half the mobs.<ul> <li>Also moved some of the more complex and confusing example scripts to an /advanced/ folder.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Updated the various base scripts.</li> <li>Updated/improved some of the documentation.</li> <li>There's a new base in the AI called base_self_adjust.<ul> <li>This handles not only the self adjust system, but anything else that may affect mob XP.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Moved a bunch of stuff from various includes to base_monser_shared.</li> <li>There's a new base_stripped_ai that handles the \"extra\" things mobs without AI's need to function proper.

By default, MSR will generate a crashed.cfg file in its directory whenever the server changes maps, which is executed as a launch parameter in the restarter script to boot the server back up on that map in case of a crash. Next patch will bring the ability to specify the name of the crashed.cfg for running multiple servers, and I will add those commands to this list when they are released.  </p> <p>Note: if running multiple servers, don't launch all the batch files at once, as one restarter will bind to all of the servers and it will not reboot until they all crash.</p>"},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/","title":"Master Sword: Rebirth Overview","text":"<p>Welcome to the in-game section of the documentation!

It sported few maps and very limited game functionality. Yet, it set a solid precedence for what was to come and what was possible with the engine. Its ambitions were high but were limited by the technology of its time. Master Sword: Continued, simply put, was a continuation of that project with a different set of developers and a wider reaching community, releasing in the mid-to-late 2000s. The scope of the maps got wider, more items introduced, and more mechanics implemented. With time, however, the game became more unstable and as the community contributors aged, so did the mod. Eventually, development officially ceased in the mid 2010s. The source code for the game was released for whomsoever to pick up the torch and continue onward.</p> <p></p> <p>That\u2019s what leads us here; to Master Sword: Rebirth. Think of it as \u201cMaster Sword: Continued: Continued\u201d where the scope of the game has widened, more features introduced, and a much, much more stable gaming experience all working on the same game engine that started this entire project over 20 years ago. Having started up in the early 2020s, Master Sword: Rebirth seeks to recapture that old school gaming magic that has seemingly been lost to time. The modification focuses on an \"MMO-lite\" design with persistent characters across an in-game network called \"FuzzNet\" or \"FN\" which will save your characters' progress between servers that are FN enabled.</p>"},{"location":"Game-Wiki-Articles/#what-happened-to-msc-mss-and-the-msremakecom-forums","title":"What happened to MS:C, MS:S, and the msremake.com forums?","text":"Click or tap to Open/Close <p>Throughout Master Sword: Continued\u2019s development, many teams have branched off to create their own versions on different engines.
