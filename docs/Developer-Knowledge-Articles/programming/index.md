# Programming

This needs to be filled with high quality, relevant information!



* Programming Overview

    We could always use some talented HLSDK (C/C++) programmers to help us address any of the issues [tracked on github.](https://github.com/MSRevive/MasterSwordRebirth/issues)

    * Scripting
    
    Majority of the game logic like NPCs and items are handled by the scripts, if you would like to contribute with that then feel free to look through the [repo here](https://github.com/MSRevive/MSCScripts) or feel free to ask in our Discord on what part you can help with!
