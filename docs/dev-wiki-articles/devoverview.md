# Developing for Master Sword: Rebirth Overview
## Overview
This page should give you a general overview about developing for Master Sword: Rebirth. Inside, you can find sub-sections according to the type of content you want to develop.



## Programming
We could always use some talented HLSDK (C/C++) programmers to help us address any of the issues [tracked on github.](https://github.com/MSRevive/MasterSwordRebirth/issues)

### Scripting
Majority of the game logic like NPCs and items are handled by the scripts, if you would like to contribute with that then feel free to look through the [repo here](https://github.com/MSRevive/MSCScripts) or feel free to ask in our Discord on what part you can help with!

## Audio
