The Demon Claws are a medium tier Martial Arts gauntlet and are wieldable at level 15. Demon Claws are a weaker variant of Infernal Claws, but they are still capable of devastating enemies well into late game. The Demon Claws have two abilities; when you charge the weapon to red, it will perform a Soul Drain, taking half of your current mana, multiplying it by 3, and converting it into magic damage. The alternate ability will do a speed attack.

### Abilities

#### Soul Drain

Charging the Demon Claws to red will perform a Soul Drain. A Soul Drain consumes half of your current mana, multiplies it by 3, and converts it into magic damage. Although Martial Arts is the main skill required to use Demon Claws, Spell Casting plays a bigger role in the damage of Soul Drain only because it converts half your current mana into damage.

#### Speed Attack

Though not nearly as potent as Soul Drain, Speed Attack can still manage to get some more damage in the enemy before you can re-charge your Soul Drain again. Costing 10 mana each swipe, Speed Attack will allow you to get four swipes in at your enemy in a second, also dealing magic damage, instead of the normal slash damage.
